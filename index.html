        <p style="display: inline-block; width: 25%" id="paragraph">"The lady's not for turning" was a phrase used by Margaret Thatcher, 
            then Prime Minister, in her speech to the Conservative Party Conference on 10 October 1980. 
            The term has thus been applied as a name to the speech in its entirety. It is considered 
            a defining speech in Thatcher's political development,[1] becoming something of a Thatcherite motto</p>
